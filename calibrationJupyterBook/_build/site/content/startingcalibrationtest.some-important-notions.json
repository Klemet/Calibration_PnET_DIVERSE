Let’s call these datasets “climate data stream”, which are a time series of all climate variable necessary for PnET-Succession for one location, or one cell of the landscape. Indeed, you probably gathered empirical data from a large area (or even a reasonably-size landscape) for the calibration; but that means that a lot of different local climate data streams will be associated with your overall empirical data.
