This step is very important, because that’s where we are going to calibrate some of the most sensitive parameters of PnET-Succession. It’s also the step where we’re going to effectively give the “upper bound” of the performance of the tree species calibrated. It’s crucial to get this upper bound right, because the algorithm and equations of PnET-Succession are mostly based on photosynthesis reduction factors (linked to light, water, age, temperature, CO2, etc.) that are going to reduce the growth of the tree species bellow this upper bound. If this upper bound is too high, you’ll overestimate the growth of the species most of the time (if not all of the time); but you can also underestimate it by setting it too low.","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"FK6uXbI1hd"}],"key":"vKtbUjAyfq"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The empirical growth area you’re getting here is used to have an estimate of this upper bound.
