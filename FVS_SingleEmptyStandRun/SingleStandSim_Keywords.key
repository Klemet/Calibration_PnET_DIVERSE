COMMENT
The following lines are used to produce a "Carbon report" with the Fire and Fuel extension of FVS.
See user guide for more : https://www.fs.usda.gov/fmsc/ftp/fvs/docs/gtr/FFEguide.pdf
CARBCALC 1 1 is used to say that we want the report in metric tons/ha (not us tons), and that a more refined algorithm for biomass estimation be used (Jenkins algorithm, which estimates bark biomass in contrast to the regular algorithm).
CARBREPT is used to output the report in the main output (.out) file of the simulation.
