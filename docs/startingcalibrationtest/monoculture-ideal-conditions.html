mortality of a given tree species in “ideal” conditions. This means simulating a monoculture (no light competition with another species) on a mesic soil that retains water correctly (no drought, but no watterlogging either) and with a very mild, average historical climate (no extremes, especially in precipitations and temperatures).</p><p>By doing so, we can isolate the effect of the many parameters and factor that influence tree growth, and focus on the few parameters that should (on a theoritical level) influence tree growth and mortality in ideal conditions :</p><ul><li><abbr aria-label="Fraction of the active woody biomass (above or belowground) of a cohort that determines the amount of foliage maintained each year." class="border-b border-dotted cursor-help" data-state="closed">FracFol</abbr></li><li><abbr aria-label="Foliar nitrogen content (in % by weight) for the leaves of the species." class="border-b border-dotted cursor-help" data-state="closed">FolN</abbr></li><li><abbr aria-label="Fraction of wood biomass lost per year." class="border-b border-dotted cursor-help" data-state="closed">TOWood</abbr></li><li><abbr aria-label="Fraction of root biomass lost per year." class="border-b border-dotted cursor-help" data-state="closed">TORoot</abbr></li><li><abbr aria-label="Specific leaf weight at the top of the canopy." class="border-b border-dotted cursor-help" data-state="closed">SLWmax</abbr></li><li><abbr aria-label="Fraction of the active woody biomass (above or belowground) of a cohort that determines the amount of foliage maintained each year." class="border-b border-dotted cursor-help" data-state="closed">FracFol</abbr> (pioneers species tend to have relatively high values)</li><li><abbr aria-label="Foliar nitrogen content (in % by weight) for the leaves of the species." class="border-b border-dotted cursor-help" data-state="closed">FolN</abbr> (pioneers species tend to have relatively high values)</li><li><abbr aria-label="Fraction of non-foliar biomass that is allocated belowground (root pool)." class="border-b border-dotted cursor-help" data-state="closed">FracBelowG</abbr></li></ul><p>To make sure your species sees the conditions of the simulation as really ideal (so that you can, again, isolate the effect from other parameters), you can even put <abbr aria-label="Optimal average daytime temperature for photosynthesis." class="border-b border-dotted cursor-help" data-state="closed">PsnTOpt</abbr> for your species to a value matching the climate inputs during the three warmest months of the growing season.

At it grows, its maintenance cost (in carbon) will grow; but its photosynthesis will be reduced through a reduction factor, and will completly stop as the cohort reaches the “longevity” core species parameter for its species. This is how tree cohort die of old age in PnET-Succession : by becoming progressively unable to sustain their maintenance costs through photosynthesis.</p><p>As such, there are two targets that are being calibrated here : 1) the age where photosynthesis will start declining because of age, and 2) the age where the photosynthesis reduction factor will become so low that the cohort will die by lack of ressources. These two targets are shown on the following figure :</p><p> <div class="" style="width:600px"><img id="JYLo1uc1ge" style="margin:0 auto" src="https://klemet.github.io/Calibration_PnET_DIVERSE/build/14232857c4e474f60fe4aad7bf85497d.png" alt="image.png" data-canonical-url="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGg...5ErkJggg==" class=""/></div></p><p>The first target (initiation of decline) is defined in PnET with the parameter <abbr aria-label="Reduction factor of photosynthesis as the age of an age cohort increases." class="border-b border-dotted cursor-help" data-state="closed">PsnAgeRed</abbr>, which controls when the photosynthesis reduction factor fAge starts declining, and how fast.</p><p>The second target (age of cohort death) is influenced by the start of the decline (first target), but also  with the “longevity” parameter given in the “Core” species parameter file (e.g. <code>species.txt</code> in <code>/SimulationFiles/\PnETGitHub_OneCellSim_v8</code>). When the age of the cohort reaches the “longevity” parammeter, the photosynthesis reduction factor fAge will reach 0 (no more photosynthesis takes place). Of course, the cohort will most likely die before it reaches 0 because its photosynthesis will have been too low for too much time, which will have depleted its ressources before fAge reaches 0. As such, you should try to input a “longevity” parameter value in the species parameter file that will kill your cohort at the age you want (e.g. that correspond to empirical data) in interaction with your first target. Note again that the cohort will very likely die <strong>before</strong> the longevity parameter.</p><p>As to where you can get estimates of these two targets (initation of decline and age of cohort death) for your species, this gets a bit complex. The decreasing part of the empirical biomass growth data that you might have used so far often contain the effect of other factors that affect tree morality including human harvesting, natural disturbance and diseases, and competition with other trees. However, as we are simulating tree growth in ideal conditions, we are trying to isolate the effect of senescence from these other factors. As such, the empirical biomass data you have will most likely not be a good target to match (as you will over-estimate senescence if you try to match them).</p><p>As such, there are several options to get the initiation of decline and age of cohort death. Here are some of them :</p><ul><li>For the age of cohort death, you could try to obtain individual tree age data from sample plots of forest inventory, and find the 99th percentile (to avoid outlayers) of tree age for your species. This should give you a good estimate of the maximum age observed for this species, which should be as close as can be to something like a “age of cohort death in ideal growth conditions” as we’re trying to find here.<ul><li>Be careful of the reported values in the litterature for the longevity of the species. These are often expert opinion, and might represent what experts often see in the field, which is influenced by other causes of mortality (competition, climate, disturbances, etc.) that you don’t want to take into account here.</li></ul></li><li>For the initiation of decline, you can :<ul><li>Use reported values of longevity in the litterature, which are often the result of rule-of-thumb or expert opinion as noted above, but which can be interpreted as the initiation of decline; for the age of cohort death, you could rather use empirical values of maximum tree age (see above). This is the methodology used by Brian Sturtevant’s team.</li><li>Take a percentile of the tree ages from the same tree age data you used for the age of cohort death (see above); for example, 75th or 80th percentile.</li><li>Use a rule-of-thumb and set the initiation of decline to half or 3/4 of the age of cohort death.</li><li>Use the default value of <abbr aria-label="Reduction factor of photosynthesis as the age of an age cohort increases." class="border-b border-dotted cursor-help" data-state="closed">PsnAgeRed</abbr> in PnET (5), or the same value for every species. <a
